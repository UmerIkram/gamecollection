					<p>I have not played previous <i>Need For Speed</i> games, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this game. There are two modes in this game: You can either be a cop and catch racers, or you can be a racer and escape cops or race other racers. The graphics were amazing and I enjoyed the roam aspect of the game. You had a full map to race around on. You could just cruise, or play different types of races. Racers and Cops had different options for cars and upgrades, which kept the game interesting. I personally really enjoyed this game but I haven't played enough racing games to say that this is the best</p>
