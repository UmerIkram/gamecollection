					<p>This paragraph is a little blurb about me. It's meant to be an introduction into who I am as a gamer. I've been playing since I was a child. My first console was the Nintendo 64. And I had the original Xbox... Like the Original. The OG of gaming systems. But all my friends had the playstation and so I had a lot of experiance playing on that too. I currently have the Xbox One and I love it, although all of my friends have the PS4.</p>
